# In-guest BN254 Groth16 verifier — scope (T_SWAP_BATCH bridge onboarding)

Companion to ops/DESIGN-bridge-multiasset-provenance.md. The one Tacit op the generalized conservation
kernel only HALF-covers is `T_SWAP_BATCH` (0x2F, the confidential AMM batch): its aggregate per-asset
conservation IS `asset_scoped_kernel_verify` on the net deltas, but the PER-RECEIPT split (per-trader
amounts hidden in BabyJubJub Pedersen) is bound only by a **BN254 Groth16** clearing proof. To onboard a
batch receipt as real (bridgeable), the reflection guest must verify that Groth16 — otherwise a trader could
over-state their receipt inside an aggregate-conserving batch and bridge unbacked value. This doc scopes
that verifier.

## What it proves + why it's needed

The batch Groth16 (snarkjs/circom, BN254) proves: given the intent input commitments + the pool reserves,
the receipt commitments are the correct uniform-price clearing (each trader gets exactly their cleared
amount). The reflection needs this so EACH receipt can be onboarded INDEPENDENTLY (one trader bridging
without the others' witnessed amounts). Without it, only whole-batch onboarding (all receipts + the
aggregate identity) would be sound — impractical for on-demand bridging.

## The verification (standard Groth16)

Proof `(A ∈ G1, B ∈ G2, C ∈ G1)`; vk `(α∈G1, β∈G2, γ∈G2, δ∈G2, IC[0..n]∈G1)`; public inputs `x[1..n]`.
```
vk_x = IC[0] + Σ x[i]·IC[i]
e(A, B) == e(α, β) · e(vk_x, γ) · e(C, δ)
```
One Miller-loop-heavy pairing check (4 pairings) on BN254 + an n-term G1 multiexp for `vk_x`.

## Dependency + cost

- **SP1 has BN254 precompiles** (it uses BN254 for its own recursion). The cleanest path is a no-std BN254
  Groth16 verifier built on the SP1-patched `bn` crate (the same machinery `sp1-verifier` uses for SP1's
  own Groth16), adapted to the **snarkjs** vk/proof encoding (snarkjs G2 Fp2 limb order + the
  `IC[0] + Σ x·IC` public-input convention differ from gnark). Alternative: SP1-patched `ark-bn254` +
  `ark-groth16`.
- **Cost:** a BN254 pairing is ~hundreds of K–low-millions of guest cycles even WITH precompiles; 4 pairings
  + the multiexp make this the single heaviest reflection operation. It runs once per batch folded (not per
  receipt), so it amortizes over the batch's receipts. Acceptable but must be measured on the box.
- Adding a BN254 curve dependency to `cxfer-core` (shared, no-std) is a real decision — it grows BOTH guest
  ELFs. Gate it behind a feature or keep the verifier in the reflection bin only if the settle guest never
  needs it (it doesn't — T_SWAP_BATCH is Bitcoin-side).

## Integration (`fold_swap_batch`, when the circuit lands)

1. **Aggregate conservation** — `asset_scoped_kernel_verify` on the batch's net `(Δa, Δb)` vs the
   intent/receipt commitments (HAVE this primitive).
2. **Groth16 verify** — `groth16_bn254_verify(BATCH_VK, proof, public_inputs)`, with `BATCH_VK` the
   ceremony-produced vk baked into the reflection guest (rotates `BITCOIN_RELAY_VKEY` on change), and
   `public_inputs` RE-DERIVED by the reflection from the on-chain batch envelope (net deltas, reserves,
   receipt commitments) so a prover can't feed forged signals.
3. **Per-receipt onboarding** — each receipt opens to its cleared amount under a reflection-witnessed
   blinding (the `fold_lp_remove` shape), then onboard it (real, live, bridgeable).
4. **Reserve update** — pool reserves move by the public net deltas; registry advanced.

## Ceremony status — CONCLUDED (2026-06; not a blocker)

The Phase-2 ceremony IS done: the canonical Groth16 vk is pinned at `CANONICAL_AMM_VK_CID =
bafkreibjpe4xfqtq2ziki4uupydnkeiakqi76m674xtdhmxnfbrn4iomp4` (the ceremony bundle at
`CANONICAL_CEREMONY_CID = bafybeidq2ahzte4sfiqjsmhqta62ufenpppzpch5ppry55tzxzlvltxy2u`, `verification_key.json`
inside it). So the circuit + vk + public-signal layout EXIST — `T_SWAP_BATCH` is NOT blocked. The verifier can
be built against the REAL circuit.

Plan to close it:
1. **Build + unit-test the general `groth16_bn254_verify`** (the pairing equation + snarkjs format adaptation
   + the BN254 dependency wiring) against the ceremony `verification_key.json` + a real batch proof vector.
   This is the reusable core and the bulk of the lift.
2. **Bake `BATCH_VK`** — parse the ceremony `verification_key.json` into the const G16Vk baked into the
   reflection guest (rotates `BITCOIN_RELAY_VKEY` on change, like any guest constant).
3. **Pin the public-input layout** from the circuit (the batch's net deltas, reserves, receipt commitments)
   so the reflection re-derives the public inputs from the on-chain envelope + checks them against the proof.
4. **`fold_swap_batch`** = the aggregate `asset_scoped_kernel_verify` (have it) + `groth16_bn254_verify` +
   per-receipt witnessed openings (the `fold_lp_remove` shape) + the net-delta reserve update.

The first artifact to pull is the ceremony `verification_key.json` (from the CID) — its `nPublic` +
`IC` length fix the public-signal count, and its `vk_alpha_1/beta_2/gamma_2/delta_2` are the baked const.

## Progress (2026-06-16) — vk pinned + parser landed

- **vk artifact pinned + CID-verified.** `contracts/sp1/confidential/fixtures/amm_ceremony_vk.json` (the full
  bundle) + `swap_batch_vk.json` (extracted). Its sha256 == the `CANONICAL_AMM_VK_CID` multihash digest
  (verified, not a gateway substitution). The bundle has `lp_add` (nPublic 5), `lp_remove` (8), and
  **`swap_batch` (nPublic 123, IC 124)** — all BN254 groth16. (lp_add/lp_remove also have circuits, but the
  reflection bridges those via the secp Schnorr kernels already; only swap_batch's per-receipt split needs
  the Groth16.)
- **Parser + types landed (cxfer-core, locally tested).** `dec_to_be32` (snarkjs decimal → BE-32 field bytes,
  overflow-checked), `G1Aff`/`G2Aff`/`G16Vk`/`G16Proof`. KAT `parse_swap_batch_ceremony_vk` parses the REAL
  ceremony vk → the 124-IC G16Vk (every element a valid field byte) — the foundation for baking `BATCH_VK`.

**Remaining to close it:**
1. **The BN254 pairing** — `groth16_bn254_verify` (the skeleton below) over a BN254 crate (SP1
   precompile-accelerated `bn`, or `ark-bn254`/`ark-groth16`), in the reflection bin. Parse the field bytes
   into the crate's G1/G2 (handle the snarkjs Fp2 limb order), run the multi-pairing == 1 check. Unit-test
   against a real swap_batch proof vector before trusting it.
2. **Bake `BATCH_VK`** — convert the parsed G16Vk to a guest const (or `include_bytes!` the field-byte blob).
3. **The 123 public-signal layout** — pin what the circuit exposes from the worker's `T_SWAP_BATCH` validation
   (index.js ~24259: aggregate Pedersen identity per asset, net deltas, reserves, per-intent commitments) so
   the reflection re-derives the public inputs from the on-chain envelope + checks them against the proof.
4. **`fold_swap_batch`** — aggregate `asset_scoped_kernel_verify` (have it) + `groth16_bn254_verify` +
   per-receipt witnessed openings + net-delta reserve update.
